## 🔧 Tools & Techniques
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Data Cleaning**: duplicates, missing values, date formatting  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: groupby, aggregation, descriptive statistics  
- **Visualization**: bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, heatmaps

## 📊 Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted `Order Date` into datetime format.  
2. **Exploration**: Aggregated sales and profit by categories, sub-categories, regions, and customers.  
3. **Visualization**: Used bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps to show sales trends, profit margins, and discount effects.  
4. **Insights**: Derived business-oriented takeaways from patterns observed in data.

## 🔑 Key Findings

### 🛍️ Categories & Sub-Categories
- **Office Supplies** had the highest number of sales, followed by Furniture and Technology.
- **Phones and Chairs** were the top-selling sub-categories.
- Despite high sales, **Tablets, Bookcases, and Chairs** generated negative profit → possible pricing/cost issues.
- **Furniture and Office Supplies** had higher discounts compared to Technology.
- Discounts showed a **weak negative correlation** with sales and profit → heavy discounts did not guarantee higher revenue.

### 🌍 Regional Analysis
- **East and West regions** generated the highest sales and profit.
- **Central region** underperformed in both sales and profit.
- Recommendation: Focus on Technology in East/West/Central, and Office Supplies in East/West.

### 📈 Time Trends
- Sales showed a **gradual upward trend** across years.
- **November and December** consistently had the highest sales → strong holiday effect.
- Profit increased overall, though there was a dip in 2018 before recovery.

### 📦 Profitability & Operations
- Several products identified as **loss-making items** → review pricing, cost, or promotional strategies.
- Shipping mode showed little correlation with profit or delivery time → other factors more influential.

## 💡 Overall Insight
The company has strong growth and seasonal sales spikes, but profitability is weakened by:
- Over-discounting
- Loss-making products
- Underperformance in the Central region

👉 By optimizing discount strategies and focusing on high-margin regions/products, the company can maximize profitability.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build an interactive dashboard (Tableau/Power BI).
- Perform customer segmentation (RFM analysis).
- Experiment with forecasting models for future sales.
