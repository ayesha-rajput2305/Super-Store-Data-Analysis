# 📊 Data Analysis of Superstore Sales
By **Ayesha DS**

---

## 📝 Context
With growing demands and cut-throat competition in the market, a Superstore giant is seeking insights to understand what works best for them.  

They want to know:  
- Which products, regions, categories, and customer segments to **target or avoid**?  
- Where do **profits/losses** occur and why?  
- How do **seasonal patterns, discounts, and shipping modes** affect performance?  

👉 You can even take this further and try building a **Regression model** to predict *Sales* or *Profit*.

The goal is not just crunching numbers, but also delivering **business insights** for better decisions.
